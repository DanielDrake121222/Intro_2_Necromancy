# Intro_2_Necromancy
This should serve as a guide for any who is interested in summoning the undead by running the zombie programming language. 

Running the code:

Download all the files and put them in a folder. 
Navigate to the folder. 

type python zombie1_1.py hell.txt
If "Hello World!" appears then you are all set. 
If not then you may need to install python.

About the language: 

For the original details go to this website and read.

I have added a feature to the language. 

type "command [entity-name]" to talk to one of your entities. 

When the program runs, the necromancer will be able to talk to one of the undead. 
The entity may then remember whatever the necromancer has stated.
